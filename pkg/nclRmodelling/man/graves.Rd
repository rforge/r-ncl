\description{
The data are from 101 consecutive patients attending a combined
thyroid-eye clinic. The patients have an endocrine disorder, Graves'
Ophthalmopathy, which affects various aspects of their eyesight. The
ophthalmologist measures various aspects of their eyesight and constructs an
overall index of how the disease affects their eyesight. This is the
Ophthalmic Index (OI) given in the dataset. The age of the patient and their
sex are also recorded. In practice, and as this is a chronic condition which
can be ameliorated but not cured, the OI would be monitored at successive
clinic visits to check on the patient's progress. However, these data are
obtained at presentation. We are interested in how OI changes with age and
gender.
