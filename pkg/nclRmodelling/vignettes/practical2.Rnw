\section{Simple linear regression}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \newthought{Consider the} data in table \ref{T1} for ice cream sales at Luigi
  Minchella's ice cream parlour.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a linear regression of $y$ on $x$. Should temperature be included
  in the model?
<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
x = c(4,4,7,8,12,15,16,17,14,11,7,5)
y = c(73, 57, 81, 94, 110, 124, 134, 139, 124, 103, 81, 80)
m = lm(y~x)
summary(m)
##The p-value for the gradient is 9.9e-09
##This suggests temperatue is useful
@

\item Calculate the sample correlation coefficient $r$. Perform a hypothesis
  test, where $H_0: \rho =0$ and $H_1: \rho \ne 0$.\sidenote{Where $\rho$ is the
    population correlation coefficient.} Compare this $p$-value to the $p$-value
  for testing if $\beta_1 =0$.

<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
##The p-value for the correlation is also 9.9e-09
cor.test(x, y)
@  
\item Construct a graph of the data. Add a dashed red line indicating the line
  of best fit.
<<F1, fig.keep='none', echo=(1:2)*echo>>=
plot(x, y, xlab="Temp", ylab="Sales")
abline(m, col=2, lty=2)

<<eval=FALSE, echo=echo, results=results>>=
text(5, 130, "r=0.983")

\item Plot the standardised residuals against the fitted values. Does the graph
  look random?
<<F2, fig.keep='none', echo=echo>>=
##Model diagnosics look good
plot(fitted.values(m), rstandard(m))

\item Construct a q-q plot of the standardised residuals.

\item \newthought{In a study} of the effect of temperature $x$ on yield $y$ of a chemical
  process, the data in table \ref{T2} was obtained.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a linear regression of $y$ on $x$.
\item Calculate the sample correlation coefficient $r$.
\item Plot the data and add the line of best fit to your plot.

\section{Multiple linear regression}
\begin{enumerate}


 
\item \newthought{The data} (below) are from 101 consecutive patients attending a combined
  thyroid-eye clinic. The patients have an endocrine disorder, Graves'
  Ophthalmopathy, which affects various aspects of their eyesight. The
  ophthalmologist measures various aspects of their eyesight and constructs an
  overall index of how the disease affects their eyesight. This is the
  Ophthalmic Index (OI) given in the dataset. The age of the patient and their
  sex are also recorded. In practice, and as this is a chronic condition which
  can be ameliorated but not cured, the OI would be monitored at successive
  clinic visits to check on the patient's progress. However, these data are
  obtained at presentation. We are interested in how OI changes with age and
  gender. The data can be obtained from

<<>>=
library(nclRmodelling)
data(graves)
@ 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit the multivariate regression model predicting OI from age and gender.
\item Examine the Studentized residual plots. Is there anything that would
  suggest you have a problem with your model? What do you do?
\end{enumerate}
\item \newthought{Dr Phil} comes to see you with his data. He believes that IQ can be
  predicted by the number of years education. Dr Phil does not differentiate
  between primary, secondary and tertiary education. He has four variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cc{IQ} - the estimated IQ of the person (the response variable);
\item \cc{AgeBegin} - the age of the person when they commenced education;
\item \cc{AgeEnd} - the age of the person when they finished education;
\item \cc{TotalYears} - the total number of years a person spent in education.
\end{itemize}
The data can be obtained from:

<<>>=
data(drphil)
@ 

Read the data into R and fit the linear regression model:
\[
IQ = \beta_0 + \beta_1 AgeBegin + \beta_2 AgeEnd + \beta_3 TotalYears + \epsilon
\]
Explain what is wrong with this model? Suggest a possible remedy. 

<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
(m = lm(IQ ~ AgeBegin + AgeEnd + TotalYears, data=drphil))
#The problem is TotalYears = AgeEnd - AgeBegin
#Solution: remove TotalYears
@

\section{One way ANOVA tables}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \newthought{A pilot study} was developed to investigate whether music
  influenced exam scores. Three groups of students listened to 10 minutes of
  Mozart, silence or heavy metal before an IQ test. The results of the IQ test
  are as follows
  
  \begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}l lllllll@{}}
      \toprule
      Mozart &  109 & 114 &  108 &  123 &  115 &  108 & 114\\
      Silence & 113 & 114 &  113 &  108 &  119 &  112 & 110 \\
      Heavy Metal & 103  & 94   &114 &  107 &  107 &  113 & 107\\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Results from the study on how music affects examination performance.}
  \end{table}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct a one-way ANOVA table. Are there differences between treatment groups?
<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
x1 = c(109, 114, 108, 123, 115, 108, 114)
x2 = c(113, 114, 113, 108, 119, 112, 110)
x3 = c(103, 94, 114, 107, 107, 113, 107)
dd = data.frame(values = c(x1, x2, x3), type = rep(c("M", "S", "H"), each=7))
m = aov(values ~ type, dd)
summary(m)
##The p value is around 0.056.
##This suggests a difference may exist.
@
\item Check the standardised residuals of your model.

<<F3, fig.keep='none', echo=echo, results=results>>=
plot(fitted.values(m), rstandard(m))
## Residual plot looks OK

\newthought{The following sections} use the results of the Olympic heptathlon
competition, Seoul, 1988. To enter the data into R, use the following commands:

<<>>=
data(hep)
##Remove the athletes names and final scores.
hep_s = hep[,2:8]
@ 

\section{Hierarchical clustering}

\newthought{Using the heptathlon} data set, carry out a clustering analysis. Try
different distance methods and clustering functions.

<<fig.keep="none", echo=echo, results=results>>=
plot(hclust(dist(hep_s)), labels=hep[,1])
@ 

\section{Principal components analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the correlation matrix of the \cc{hep} data set.
<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
##Round to 2dp
signif(cor(hep_s), 2)
@

\item Carry out a PCA on this data set.\sidenote{Remember to remove the
athletes names.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Keep \cc{score} in your PCA analysis. What happens and why? Do you think
    you should remove \cc{score}?
<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
##Remove:
##1st column: athletes name
##Last column: It's a combination of the other columns
dd = hep[ ,2:8]

##Run principle components
prcomp(dd)
@

  \item Do you think you need to scale the data?
<<echo=echo, results=results>>=
##Yes!. run800m dominates the loading since
##the scales differ
@

  \item Construct a biplot of the data.
<<echo=echo, results=results, fig.keep="none">>=
prcomp(dd, scale=TRUE)
biplot(prcomp(dd, scale=TRUE))
@

  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Survival analysis}

This final section, is meant to give you a taste at other statistical techniques
available. R has many packages\sidenote{A package is just an ``add-on'' that
  provides new functionality.} available. To install a package, we use the command:

<<eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages("survival")
@ 

\noindent Once the package is installed, we load it using \cc{library} function:

<<message=FALSE>>=
library(survival)
@ 

\noindent The data set we will use is the \cc{lung} data set\sidenote{Survival in patients
  with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.
  Performance scores rate how well the patient can perform usual daily
  activities.} - this comes with the \cc{survival} package. To load this data
set, we use the command

<<>>=
data(lung)
@ 

\noindent We the use the \cc{dim} function to extract the number of rows and
columns:

<<>>=
dim(lung)
@ 

\noindent This creates a data frame with the following columns
\begin{itemize}
\item inst:       Institution code
\item time:       Survival time in days
\item status:     censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
\item age:        Age in years
\item sex:        Male=1 Female=2
\item ph.ecog:    ECOG performance score (0=good 5=dead)
\item ph.karno:   Karnofsky performance score (bad=0-good=100) rated by physician
\item pat.karno:  Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
\item meal.cal:   Calories consumed at meals
\item wt.loss:    Weight loss in last six months
\end{itemize}      
To begin, we create a \cc{Surv} object:\sidenote{Look at \cc{?Surv} for
  further details.}

<<results="hide">>=
Surv(lung$time, lung$status)
@ 

\noindent We can fit a Kaplein-Meier curve using the \cc{surfit} function:

<<results="hide">>=
survfit(Surv(lung$time, lung$status)~1)
@ 

\noindent and also plot survival curve

<<fig.keep="none">>=
plot(survfit(Surv(lung$time, lung$status)~1))
@ 

\noindent To fit the model using an additional covariate, we just alter the
formula:

<<fig.keep="none">>=
plot(survfit(Surv(lung$time, lung$status)~lung$sex))
@ 

\noindent \textbf{Task:} Load the \cc{heart} data set:\sidenote{Look at the help
  page: \cc{?heart}}

<<>>=
data(heart)
@ 

\noindent and make the a \cc{Surv} object

<<results="hide">>=
Surv(heart$start, heart$stop, heart$event) 
@ 

\noindent Why are three arguments in the above function? Construct a
Kaplein-Meier plot. Look at the \cc{coxph} function. Try fitting a cox
proportional hazard function.
