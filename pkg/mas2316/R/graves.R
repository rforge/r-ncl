#' The Graves data set
#' 
#' The data are from 101 consecutive patients attending a combined
#' thyroid-eye clinic. The patients have an endocrine disorder, Graves'
#' Ophthalmopathy, which affects various aspects of their eyesight. The
#' ophthalmologist measures various aspects of their eyesight and constructs
#' an overall index of how the disease affects their eyesight. This is the
#' Ophthalmic Index (OI) given in the dataset. The age of the patient and their
#' sex are also recorded. In practice, and as this is a chronic condition 
#' which can be ameliorated but not cured, the OI would be monitored at 
#' successive clinic visits to check on the patient's progress. However, 
#' these data are obtained at presentation. We are interested in how OI 
#' changes with age.
