#' The ASH30 study
#' 
#' The ASH30 study comprises data on 195 people (84 males and 111 females) 
#' measured in 1980, when they were about twelve years old, and again in 
#' 2000, when they were about thirty-two. The project measured many 
#' variables but we will use only the height (h in metres),
#' weight (w in kilograms) and the Body Mass Index 
#' (BMI): BMI = w / h^2. 
#' 
#' The \code{ash30} data set contains 
#' both males and females. The \code{ash30f} and \code{ash30m}
#' data sets contain the data for female and male participents only.
